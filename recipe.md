Pour luke warm water to abowl. If you live in avery cold place,just warm up your bowl for proofing yeast . Firstly make sure the watr is just warm

an ideal temperature of water is 40 to 43 C.Just dip your finger in the water to check if its just warm.Hot water will kill the yeast and cannot be used further.

Add yeast to the warm water.

Sprinkle sugar as well.

Stir it gently.Allow this to rest undisturbed for 10 to 12 minuites.The mixture must turn frothy and bubbly.If
you fail to get a frothy mixture ,do not proceed further with this yeast.It is inactive.So just discard this.
If you fail with the freothy mixture change the yeast and start again.

When the yeast turns frothy ,add flour.Hear i have used unbleached all purpose flour.If you donot get organic one,just replace with whole wheat flour.
Make a thin pizza.It will turn out out good.You can also use half-whole wheat flour and half maida.

Next add olive oil and salt

Mix to make dough . If needed add more water and knead the dough for 5 to 6 minuites . The dough must turn very soft and elastic.When you poke your finger gently the dough must bounce back.
This will happen if you use all puspode flour . For atta you will have to knead for longer about 9minuites .

Make aball and next apply athin layer of oil to prevent the dough from drying up .

Cower with amoist cloth.Rest in a warm place until the dough dubles in size . If your oven has a setting for rising the dough then you can use that as well .
Depending on the temparature,the dough may take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours . But still i advice not to go by timings but to double it in size .

Meanwhile making pizza sauce keep the veggies ready . Grate the cheese .

Dough has doubled in just 45 minuites for me . I made 1 pizza that day and refregerated th rest for the next day . just wrapped it ina cling wrap and put in the fridge . 
The flavir of the yeast dough gets muck better as it ages in the fridge . this keeps good for 2days . If refregerating,then allow it to come down to room temperature before using . I allowed to rest fore 90 minuites.
When you see the dough is ready,preheat the oven to 220 to 240 Cfor atleast 20 to 25 minuites. If you have a pizza stone,heat that in the oven as well.

Next transfer the dough to the work area and punch it down to deflate.Devide the dough to 2 or 3 parts depending on the size you prefer,I made 9inch thin crust and then two 6 inch thoc pizzas.

Sprikle some corn meal evenly on every on a tray.Flatten a ball and add few drops of oil.Begin to spread and stretch the dough.Flatten to a 9inch thin even base

Next spread pizza sauce as desired . For the pizza please follow you own way or have another advises.

Lastly layer chese.Then veggies of your choice.We prefer bell peppers,onions and olives.You can also use cauliflowers,mushrooms and firm ripe deseeded tomatoes.Sprinkle italian herbs  and chilli flakes if you desire.

Bake it for 8 to 10 minuites or until the cheese turns gold

your Veg Pizza is ready
